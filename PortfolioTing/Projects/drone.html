            EDD Capstone Design Project
        </br>
            My Engineering capstone project in highschool. Worked with a group to define a problem and design and create a solution.
        </br>
        </br>
            Our Problem
        </br>
            With an average response time of 8 minutes, ambulances often take too long to arrive in critical situations in which lives may be lost, with a tenth of calls leading to a half hour or more wait time until the ambulance arrives. Every minute in which a large vessel stroke is left untreated, a patient loses over 1.9 million neurons, and every minute in which cardiac arrest is untreated by CPR dramatically increases chances of death. Anaphylaxis can kill in 15 minutes, and every second matters in these critical situations. Potential inadequacy of ambulance response times is compounded by the fact that many bystanders do not know how to take the proper life saving emergency response measures while waiting for an ambulance, and often lack essential equipment to do so. Half of Americans claim to know how to perform CPR, but less than 20% of the half actually know the proper technique. The patient must be able to receive all available care with minimal delay, to maximize their chances at a full recovery, a need suboptimally satisfied today.

        </br>
            Our Solution
        </br>
            Our final solution is a “mid sized” drone with an integrated compartment to carry medical supplies to the scene faster than an ambulance. The drone will also feature autopilot capabilities, so that the EMS worker does not have to manually pilot it (less reliable), and a tablet with two way audio video communication, so that the EMS worker can train a bystander on how to use the delivered items. Lastly, the battery will be rechargeable and replaceable, allowing the batteries to be continuously swapped and cycled for unlimited missions and fast turnaround.

            Mini Design Project
        </br>
            Also did a Mini Design Project at the begining of the year that was also very cool.
