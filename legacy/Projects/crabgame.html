            Finding Mother is a "crabillicious" crab puzzle platformer, with simple drag and shoot controls and a unique stacking mechanic. Adventure as a king crab through an underwater and city zone with unique enemies, friendly crabs, and deadly challenges. Will you ascend and find the mother crab, or perish along the way? </br>
        Finding Mother was developed in unity by 4 people with no prior Unity or Pixel art experience. There is a lot of jank still left but we are all super proud of the game and plan the continue to work on it and add more content.
