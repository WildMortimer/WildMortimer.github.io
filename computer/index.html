    <h1>WC1308-EAL 8-bit Computer</h1>
    <hr>
    As a lab group in our Digital Electronics class, we started to experiment in our own time with ICs found in our classroom. We soon became interested in the creation of certain processor elements, like how memory and arithmetic operations worked and sought out a suitable model that we could use to learn these concepts that were beyond the classroom curriculum. Ben Eater had created and posted on his website his breadboarded 8-bit computer, on which we decided to base our new project. While purchasing the necessary electrical parts, we picked out a few ICs that would allow us to improve upon Ben Eater’s design. We made it our task to build, modify, and optimize the model, and since then I have been able to incorporate a larger number of instructions, larger memory, a stack, and more.
