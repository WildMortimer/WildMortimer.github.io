            WC1308-EAL Expanded 8-Bit Computer
        </br>
            Over the past year two friends and I have embarked on the grand journey that is Ben Eater's 8 Bit computer build in our high school digital electronics course. As we learned more and got more comfortable, we started looking for ways to expand the capabilities. To date we have expanded the RAM address space two 256 bytes (which includes expanding other features, such as 8 bit opcodes), added new opcodes and uCodes, created a Wi-Fi RAM programmer and assembler, and more. I have been documenting everything that we have done through module outlines, upgrade explanations, and bug descriptions. This is by no means a final draft, and will be updated and revised as we continue to add more to the design. I wanted to share all the work that we have done as a resource for those who are interested in Electrical and Computer Engineering and/or Ben Eaterâ€™s work.
